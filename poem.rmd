## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
One winter night, at half-past nine,

Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,

I had come home, too late to dine,

And supper, with cigars and wine,

Was waiting in the study.

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Whose woods these are I think I know.

His house is in the village though;

He will not see me stopping here

To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
The sun was shining on the sea,

Shining with all his might:
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
“Will you walk a little faster?”

said a whiting to a snail.

“There’s a porpoise close behind us,

and he’s treading on my tail.

See how eagerly the lobsters and

the turtles all advance!

They are waiting on the shingle—

will you come and join the dance?
